# KimPyRaptor
KimPyRaptor is an mBot based on the Arduino UNO

This project is about the KimPyRaptor. It's an mBot by makeblock. The mBot board => mCore is based on an Arduino UNO.
It's an evolving project and new things will be added in the future. But finished and documented at this point:
•	Driving/controlling the mBot using serial combination through a Python script
•	Connected the mBot/Arduino to a NodeMCU V3 for wireless control via UART
•	Discord bot for controlling KimPyRaptor
Next Up:
•	Localization => orientation => navigation using a ceiling mounted camera
•	Connecting the mBot to a NodeMCU V3 via I2C
