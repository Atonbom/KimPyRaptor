# Python and Arduino / mBot
Python is a very powerful programming language, relatively “easy” and also supports serial communication. 
And when you already have setup the Arduino side which is ready to receive commands it pretty simple.
1.	Install the Pyserial package. https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial.html 
2.	Import serial package
3.	Initialize a variable to connect to the correct COM port and baud rate
4.	Use .read() and .write() to read and write data over the COM port

The following 2 tutorials elaborate more and have some good examples:
